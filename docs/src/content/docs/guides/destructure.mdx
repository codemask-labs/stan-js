stan-js relates highly on Proxy and it comes with some limitations that you should be aware of.

```ts
export const store = createStore({
    accessToken: null as string | null,
    userInfo: null as UserInfo | null,
    get isAuthenticated() {
        return Boolean(this.accessToken) && Boolean(this.userInfo)
    }
})
```

At first you may not spot the problem with this code, but let's first change how our computed value is defined:

```ts
export const store = createStore({
    accessToken: null as string | null,
    userInfo: null as UserInfo | null,
    get isAuthenticated() {
        if (!this.accessToken) {
            return false
        }

        return Boolean(this.userInfo)
    }
})
```

It does exactly the same thing, but it is much easier to spot the problem now.

At the initial load stan-js has seen that `isAuthenicated` getter tried to access only `accessToken` property, because it was escaped with `false` before it accessed `userInfo` property. So it didn't subscribed to `userInfo` change.

We can fix this by changing our implementation to:

```ts
export const store = createStore({
    accessToken: null as string | null,
    userInfo: null as UserInfo | null,
    get isAuthenticated() {
        return [this.accessToken, this.userInfo].every(Boolean)
    }
})
```

And this will work as expected. But we highly encourage you to use destructuring assignment to avoid this kind of problems.

```ts
export const store = createStore({
    accessToken: null as string | null,
    userInfo: null as UserInfo | null,
    get isAuthenticated() {
        const { accessToken, userInfo } = this

        return Boolean(accessToken) && Boolean(userInfo)
    }
})
```

- effect
- useStoreEffect
- useStore

So keep it in mind when you are using them.
