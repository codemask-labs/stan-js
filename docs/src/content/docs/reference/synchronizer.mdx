Synchronizer is an util that allows you to synchronize store with something external like localStorage, database, device storage (MMKV, AsyncStorage) etc.

```typescript
type Synchronizer<T> = {
    value: T,
    subscribe?: (update: (value: T) => void, key: string) => void,
    // If synchronizer doesn't have data that matches passed key, it should throw
    getSnapshot: (key: string) => T | Promise<T>,
    update: (value: T, key: string) => void
}
```

There is already implementation for persisting data on both platforms (react and react-native).

```ts
import { storage } from 'stan-js/storage'
```
It takes two parameters - first is initial value, and the second one (which is optional) is options object with key (if the key isn't passed stan-js will pass key from the store), serialize and deserialize functions.


<Aside type="note" title="React Native MMKV">
For react-native you need to install [react-native-mmkv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-mmkv)
</Aside>
<Aside type="caution" title="React native < 0.72">
If you are using react-native older than 0.72 you need to add this to your `metro.config.js`

```js
unstable_enablePackageExports: true,
```

You can read more about it [here](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2023/06/21/package-exports-support)

#### Syncing values using synchronizer

```typescript
import { createStore } from 'stan-js'
import { storage } from 'stan-js/storage'

const { useStore } = createStore({
    counter: storage(0, { storageKey: 'counter-key' }), // number
    user: storage<string>(), // string | undefined
    cart: [] as Array<CartItem>
})
```

#### Custom serializer

If you want to store more complex objects that aren't supported by JSON you can either write your own storage synchronizer or pass custom `serialize` and `deserialize` functions to the options parameter. For example, you can use [superjson](https://github.com/blitz-js/superjson) package:
```typescript
import { createStore } from 'stan-js'
import { storage } from 'stan-js/storage'
import superjson from 'superjson'

const { useStore } = createStore({
    user: storage(new Set(), {
        serialize: superjson.stringify,
        deserialize: superjson.deserialize
    })
})
```
